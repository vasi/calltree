calltree: Log function calls with dtrace 
========================================

Usage: calltree [OPTIONS] COMMAND

For example, given the following C source in answer.c:

	#include <stdio.h>
	int foo(void) { return 41; }
	int bar(int i) { return i + foo(); }
	int main(void) {
		printf("%d\n", bar(1));
	}

$ clang -o answer answer.c
$ calltree ./answer
42
CPU FUNCTION                                 
  1  -> start                                  
  1    -> main                                 
  1      -> bar                                
  1        -> foo                              
  1        <- foo                              
  1      <- bar                                
  1    <- main                                 


You must have dtrace installed, and root privileges are required. Executables that have been stripped will not work.

Various arguments are available to change which functions are logged, run 'calltree --help' for more information.

Note that this tool is rather under-tested, consider it a prototype.
